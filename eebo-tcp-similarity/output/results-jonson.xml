			<before>ire,
               Needs nought to cloath it but the Aire:
               Yet something to the Painters view,
               Were fitly interposed, so new
               He shall (if he can understand)
               Worke by my fancy with his hand.
               Draw first a Cloud, all save her necke,
               And out of that make day to breake:
               Till like her face it doe appeare,
               And men may thinke all light rose there.
               Then let the beames of that disperse
               The Cloud, and shew the Vniverse:
               But at such distance, as the eye
               May rather it adore than spye:
               
                  The Heavens design'd, draw next a Spring,
               With all that youth, or it may bring:
               Foure Rivers, branching forth like seas,
               And Paradise confin'd in these.
               Last draw the Circle of this Globe,
               And let there be a starry Robe
               Of Constillations 'bout her hurl'd,
               And thou hast painted beauties world.
               But Painter see you doe not sell
               A Coppy of this Piece, nor tell
               VVhose 'tis: but if it favour finde,
               Next sitting wee will draw her minde.

			<content>Her Minde.
               PAynter y'are come, but may be gone,
               Now I have better thought thereon,
               This worke I can performe alone,
               And give you reasons more than one,
               Not that your Art I doe refuse,
               But here I may no Colours use;
               
                  Besides your hand will never hit
               To draw the thing that cannot sit.
               You could make shift to paint an eye,
               An Eagle towring in the skye,
               A Sun, a Sea, a Sandlesse pit,
               And these are like a Minde, not it.
               No, to expresse this Mind to sence,
               Would aske a heavens intelligence,
               Since that nothing can report that flame,
               But what's of kinne to whence it came:
               Sweet mind, then speak your self, and say
               As you goe on, by what brave way,
               Our sence you doe with knowledge fill,
               And yet remaine our wonder still.
               I call you Muse, now make it true,
               Hence forth may every line be you,
               That all may say that see the frame,
               This is no Picture, but the same:
               A mind so pure, so perfect fine,
               As 'tis not radiant, but divine,
               And so disdaining any tire,
               'Tis got where it can trye the fire.
               There (high exalted in the Spheare,
               As it another Nature were)
               It moveth all, and makes a flight,
               
                  As circular as infinite,
               Whose Notions when it would expresse
               In speech, it is with that excesse,
               Of grace and musick to the eare,
               As what it spake it planted there.
               The voyce so sweet, the words so faire,
               As some soft chime had strok'd the ayre,
               And though the sound were parted thence,
               Still left an Eccho in the sence,
               But that a minde so rapt so high,
               So swift, so pure should yet apply
               It selfe to us, and come so nigh
               Earths grossenesse, there's the how, and why?
               Is it because it sees us dull
               And stuck in Clay here, it would pull
               Vs forth by some Coelestiall slight,
               Vp to her owne sublimed height?
               Or hath shee here upon the ground,
               Some Paradise or Pallace found
               In all the bounds of Beauty fit
               For her t'inhabite? there is it.

               So polish'd, perfect, and so even,
               As it slid moulded out of Heaven.
               
                  Not swelling like the Ocean proud,
               But stooping gently as a Cloud,
               As smooth as Oyle powr'd forth, and calme
               As showres, and sweet as drops of Balme,
               Smooth, soft, and sweet, and all a flood,
               Where it may runne to any good,
               And where it stayes it there becomes,
               A nest of odours, spice, and gummes.
               In action winged as the Wind▪
               
               In rest like spirits left behind,
               Vpon a Banke or field of flowres,
               Begotten by the wind and showers,
               In the faire mansion let it rest,
               Yet know with what thou art possest,
               Thou entertaining in thy breast,
               But such a minde mak'st God a Guest.

                     Or those, who doubt the common mouth of fame,
                     And for their place, and name,
                     Cannot so safely sinne. Their chastitie
                     Is meere necessitie.
                     Nor meane we those, whom vowes and conscience
                     Haue fill'd with abstinence:
                     Though we acknowledge, who can so abstayne,
                     Makes a most blessed gayne.
                     He that for loue of goodnesse hateth ill,
                     Is more crowne-worthy still,
                     Then he, which for sinnes penaltie forbeares.
                     His heart sinnes, though he feares.
                     But we propose a person like our Doue,

                     Of old, euen by her practise to be fam'd;
                     To say, indeed, shee were the soule of heauen,

                     IF to admire were to commend my praise
                     Might then both thee, thy worke and merit raise:
                     But, as it is (the Child of Ignorance,
                     And vtter stranger to all ayre of France)
                     How can I speake of thy great paines, but erre?
                     Since they can only iudge, that can conferre.
                     Behold! the reuerend shade of BARTAS stands
                     Before my thought, and (in thy right) commands
                     That to the world I publish, for him▪ this;
                     
                        BARTAS doth wish thy English now were his.
                     So well in that are his inuentions wrought,
                     As his will now be the translation thought,
                     Thine the originall; and France shall boast,
                     No more, those mayden glories shee hath lost.

will take most dyes: so in Men, they that have the most reason are the most inalterable in their designes, and the darkest or most ignorant, do seldomest change; therfore Women changing more than Men, have also more Reason. They cannot be immutable like stocks, like stones, like the Earths dull Center; Gold that lyeth still, rusteth; Water, corrupteth; Aire that moveth not, poysoneth; then why should that which is the perfection of o</after>

                  And every Bramble Roses wear,
                  And every Worm made Silk.
                  The very Shrub did Balsom sweat,
                  And Nectar melt the Rock with heat,
                  And Earth did drink her fill:

So much of Love had nought of Lust,

               Face.
               He shall do any thing. Doctor, do you hear? this is my friend, Abel, an honest fellow; he lets me have good Tobacco, and he does not sophisticate it with Sack-lees, or Oyl, nor washes it in Muscadel, and Grains, nor buries it in Gravel, under ground, wrapt up in greasie leather, or pist clouts, but keeps it in fine Lilie-pots, that opened, smell like Conserve of Roses, or French Beans. He has his Maple block, his silver tongs, VVinchester pipes, and fire of Juniper. A neat, spruce-honest fellow, and no Goldsmith.
            
            
               Subt.
               He is a fortunate fellow, that I am sure on.
            
            
               Face.
               Already Sir, Ha you found it? Lo thee Abel.
               
            
            
               Subt.
               And in right way toward riches.—

                     CArried the frontispice of a Temple,
the Wals of which and Gates
were Brasse; the Pillers Siluer,
their Capitals and Bases Golde:
in the highest point of all was erected
a Ianus head, and ouer it
written.
                  IANO QVADRIFRONTI
SACRVM.
                  Which title of Quadrifrons is said to be giuen
him,Bassus apud Macro▪ lib. 1. Satur. ca. 9. as he respecteth all Climates, and filles all parts
of the world with his Maiestie; which Martiall
would seeme to allude vnto in that Hendicasillable,

Others haue thought it by reason of the foure Elements,
which brake out of him, being Chaos: for
Ouid is not afraide to make Chaos and Ianus the
same, in those verses

destroyer of all things, Time. VVhich labours of mine, if they yeeld thee

to this honourable Citie, whose bounty towards me, not onely in making
choise of me, to giue directions for the intire workmanship of the fiue Triumphall
Arch's builded by the same, but also (in publishing these Peeces,) I do here
gladly acknowledge to haue bene exceeding liberall.
            Nor shall it be amisse in this place to giue thee intelligence of some matters (by way of notes) which
were not fully obserude, nor </after>

                     NO more let Greece her bolder fables tell
                     Of HERCVLES, or THESEVS going to hell,
                     ORPHEVS, VLYSSES: or the Latine Muse,
                     With tales of Troyes iust knight, our faiths abuse:
                     
                     We haue a SHELTON, and a HEYDEN got,
                     Had power to act, what they to faine had not.
                     All, that they boast of STYX, of ACHERON,
                     COCYTVS, PHLEGETON, our haue prou'd in one;
                     The filth, stench, noyse: saue only what was there
                     Subtly distinguish'd, was confused here.
                     Their wherry had no saile, too; ours had none:
                     And in it, two more horride knaues, then CHARON.

                     scraps, out of every Dish,
                     Thrown forth, and rak't into the Common-tub,
